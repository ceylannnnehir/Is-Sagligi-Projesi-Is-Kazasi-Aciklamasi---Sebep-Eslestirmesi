Accident Summary Nr: 167694.015 - Employee dies from electrocution while inspecting junction b

Abstract: At 1:00 p.m. on June 24, 2024, an employee and Coworker #1 were working as electricians for an electrical contractor. The team was installing lighting switches and other associated electrical equipment in Room 716 of a commercial building. The team deenergized a circuit that supplied power to an area where they needed to perform work. They thought they had isolated the live circuit from the circuit that fed the area where they needed to work. Coworker #1 conducted some testing on a switch he was working on which was supposed to be deenergized. He discovered through testing the circuit with a hot stick that it was still energized. Coworker #1 then tested the switch with his voltage meter, which indicated a 0-voltage reading. He was not sure why the hot stick was indicating a voltage reading and how the power was getting to the switch. Coworker #1 was in charge of the site because the master electrician was not on site, so he instructed the employee to go inside Room 716 and determine whether the junction box they installed earlier in the day was indicating the same issue he had observed at the switch. After Coworker #1 instructed the employee to do the testing in the junction box, he went down to the third floor to use the bathroom. The employee went into Room 716 to conduct testing on the junction box. Coworker #2 was in the room adjacent to Room 716. Coworker #2 heard the employee yell, so he went to see what had occurred and saw the employee standing on a ladder with his upper body above the suspended ceiling. Coworker #2 attempted to initiate a conversation with the employee, but the employee was unresponsive. Coworker #2 then contacted Coworker #1 via phone to notify him of the situation. Coworker #1 returned to Room 716 to find the employee on the floor and called 911. The employee had somehow contacted a live electrical circuit and died due to being electrocuted.

4. Ladders: 1926.1053
Ladder violations are the number one violation in the construction industry in 2022, with 2,143 violations issued. In contrast, 2,026 were issued in 2021.
Per OSHA’s standards, ladders must not be overloaded, must be free from hazards like grease or anything else that makes them slippery, and defective portable ladders must be labeled and taken out of service. Usage standards are also provided for employees, including dictating that while climbing, workers must be facing the ladder and always have at least one hand on it. Further standards outlining the usage of different types of ladders exist as well.

8. Fall Protection (Training): 1926.503
Fall protection training violations are down in 2022 compared to 2021, with 110 fewer in 2022. However, there were still 1,556 violations issued for failing to meet OSHA’s standard on fall protection training.
According to OSHA standards, employers must educate workers through a training program that includes hazard identification, how to mitigate hazards, fall protection and fall arrest systems, and other fall-related information. Employers must also have written documentation to verify employees have completed this training.

9. Personal Protective Equipment: 1926.102
2022 saw a similar number of personal protective equipment violations as 2021, with 1,401 issued in 2022.

Workers must use protection when working with or exposed to hazards such as chemicals, liquids, gasses or vapors, light radiation, flying particles, and other harmful materials. Likewise, workers working in areas with potential flying objects must also wear eye protection with covered sides.
